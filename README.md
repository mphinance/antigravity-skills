## 🧠 The "Aha!" Moment

AI agents like Claude Code and Gemini are only as good as the context you provide them. Out of the box, they are brilliant generalists.

**This repository gives them a PhD in algorithmic trading and a master's in design.**

By dropping these `skills/` into your agent's workspace, you inject decades of domain expertise, algorithmic rigor, and aesthetic taste directly into their runtime. You aren't just getting scripts. You are getting autonomous agents capable of identifying market regimes, rewriting PineScript to Python, running full design critiques, and generating Substack-ready financial reports.

> **On Modularity:** A "Full Tower" audit was performed across all 113 directories. Every single skill is structurally unique. Even seemingly overlapping skills (like Breadth vs. Uptrend analyzers) are intentionally decoupled, serving as independent, uncorrelated inputs for the downstream Druckenmiller Strategy Synthesizer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the `skills/` folder into your agent's skill directory:
   - **Gemini CLI / Antigravity:** `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`
   - **Claude Code:** Your project root or global config.
3. Start your agent. It auto-detects and indexes every skill.

### 🔑 API Keys (optional)

Most skills work out of the box with zero configuration. A subset of quant screeners require paid data APIs:
